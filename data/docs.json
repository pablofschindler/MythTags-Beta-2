Descriptions of her as \"mother\" weren't always referring to motherhood in the literal sense or to parentage of other deities, but sometimes instead represented her esteem and authority as a senior deity, similar to references to major male deities such as Enlil or Anu as \"fathers.\" Certain mortal rulers claimed her as their mother, a phenomenon recorded as early as during the reign of Mesilim of Kish (c. 2700 BCE). She was the wife of Enki, though in some locations (including Nippur) her husband was \u0160ulpae instead. Initially no city had Ninhursag as its tutelary goddess.

Ishkur is already attested as the god of Karkar in the Uruk period, however evidence such as theophoric names indicates that the weather god's popularity only grew in later periods under the Akkadian name. Hadad is already attested as the name of the weather god in early sources from Ebla. In Mesopotamia these two gods started to merge in the Sargonic period, and it seems it was already impossible to find a clear distinction between them in the Ur III period. While northern texts put an emphasis on the benevolent character of the weather god as a bringer of rain, in the south he was often associated with destructive weather phenomena, including dust storms, though even there he was credited with making plant growth possible in areas which weren't irrigated. He was regarded as the son of An, though less commonly he was also referred to as a son of Enlil. His wife was Shala, while his sukkal was Nimgir, the deified lightning. In addition to being a weather god, Hadad was also a god of law and guardian of oaths, as well as a god of divination (extispicy). In these roles he was associated with Shamash. In Zabban, a city in the northeast of Babylonia, he was regarded as the head of the local pantheon. In Assyrian sources he was closely connected to military campaigns of the kings. Kurba'il on the northern frontier of the empire was regarded as his most notable cult center in neo-Assyrian times.

He was regarded as a divine judge, and kings were said to \"render justice like I\u0161taran.\" A text from the late Early Dynastic Period invokes I\u0161taran to resolve a boundary dispute between the cities of Lagash and Umma. In one of his inscriptions, King Gudea of Lagash mentions himself having installed a shrine for I\u0161taran in the temple of Ningirsu at Girsu and describes I\u0161taran as a god of justice. On kudurrus (boundary stones), I\u0161taran is often represented by a serpent, which may be Nirah or I\u0161taran himself. It is also possible that he's the god with an ophidian lower body known from cylinder seals. In a ritual associated with the Ekur temple in Nippur, I\u0161taran is a \"dying god\" and is equated with Dumuzid. A reference to I\u0161taran as a dying god appears also in a late text from Assur.

Ninazu was also a Ninurta-like warrior god, as well as the \"king of snakes.\" He was worshipped in Eshnunna during the third millennium BCE, but he was later supplanted there by Tishpak, who despite foreign origin had a similar character and attributes.

Sud, the tutelary goddess of \u0160uruppak, came to be regarded as one and the same as Ninlil, and the myth Enlil and Sud explain that Sud was the goddess' name before she married Enlil, receiving the name Ninlil. However, Sud was originally an independent deity who was close in character to Sudag, an alternate name of the wife of Shamash; the confusion between Sudag and Sud(/Ninlil) is reflected in a myth where Ishum, normally regarded as the son of Shamash and his wife, is instead the son of Ninlil.",

She consistently appears as the first among Inanna's courtiers in god lists, usually following Dumuzi and Ninshubur. She was portrayed as capable of \"appeasing\" Inanna, and as \"unshakably loyal\" in her devotion to her. In the Sumerian myth of Inanna and Enki, Ninshubur rescues Inanna from the monsters that Enki sends to capture her, while in Inanna's Descent into the Underworld, she pleads with the gods Enlil, Nanna and finally Enki in effort to persuade them to rescue Inanna from the Underworld. She was regarded as a wise adviser of her divine masters and human rulers alike. In addition to being the sukkal of Inanna, she also served An and the divine assembly. In later Akkadian mythology, Ninshubur was syncretized with the male messenger deities Ilabrat and Papsukkal, though this process wasn't complete until Seleucid times.

Texts mentioning Nisaba are sporadically attested as far west as Ebla and Ugarit, though it is uncertain if she was actively venerated further west than Mari. Nisaba was the mother of the goddess Sud, syncretised with Enlil's wife Ninlil, and as a result she was regarded as his mother in law. While a less common tradition identified her as the daughter of Enlil, she was usually regarded as the daughter of Ura\u0161, and references to Anu or Ea as her father are known from first millennium BCE literature. Her husband was the god Haya. There is little direct evidence for temples (in Nippur she was worshiped in the temple of her daughter Ninlil) and clergy of Nisaba, but literary texts were commonly ended with the doxology \"praise to Nisaba!\" or other invocations of her.

The origins of his worship reach at least to the early Iron Age, and likely to the Late Bronze Age, if not somewhat earlier. In the oldest biblical literature he possesses attributes typically ascribed to weather and war deities, fructifying the land and leading the heavenly army against Israel's enemies. The early Israelites were polytheistic and worshipped Yahweh alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah and Baal. In later centuries, El and Yahweh became conflated and El-linked epithets such as El Shaddai came to be applied to Yahweh alone, and other gods and goddesses such as Baal and Asherah were absorbed into Yahwist religion.",
